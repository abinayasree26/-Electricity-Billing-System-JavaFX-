# -Electricity-Billing-System-JavaFX-
This JavaFX application calculates electricity bills for residential customers based on the number of consumed units. It follows an object-oriented approach using an abstract Customer class and a ResidentialCustomer subclass. The GUI allows users to enter their name and consumed units, then calculates and displays the bill amount.
